# Single Image Super Resolution using GAN-SRGAN
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for single image super-resolution (SRGAN) using PyTorch. The SRGAN architecture enhances the resolution of low-resolution images, generating high-resolution images with visually appealing details.

## Features

- Implementation of SRGAN architecture, including:

    - Generator network based on ResNet blocks

    - Discriminator network for adversarial training

- Preprocessing of low-resolution and high-resolution image datasets

- Loss functions:

    - Content loss based on perceptual features

    - Adversarial loss for realistic image generation

- Training pipeline with checkpointing

- Evaluation and visualization of results

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.8
- PyTorch >= 1.10
- torchvision
- numpy
- matplotlib
- tqdm
- PIL (Pillow)

Install dependencies using:
'''
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''

## Dataset

The project uses high-resolution image datasets for training, such as DIV2K or similar. The dataset should include paired low-resolution and high-resolution images.

Prepare the dataset:

  1. Organize images into train and test directories.

  2. Preprocess images to generate low-resolution counterparts using bicubic downscaling.


## Evaluation

1. Provide a low-resolution test image or directory.

2. Run the evaluation script:
  '''
  python evaluate.py --input /path/to/low-res-image --output /path/to/output-dir
  '''
The results will include:

- High-resolution images generated by the SRGAN model

- Side-by-side comparisons of low-resolution and high-resolution images


## Results

The SRGAN model enhances image resolution effectively, with results demonstrating improved perceptual quality compared to traditional methods like bicubic interpolation.
